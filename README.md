## ✨ Highlights

- **Cinematic 3D hero** — a floating AC unit with smooth rotation, cool-airflow particles,
  blue/cyan lighting, realistic shadows, mouse parallax and scroll animation
  (React Three Fiber + Three.js + drei, lazy-loaded).
- **Interactive 3D room experience** — scroll to animate cooling airflow through a room
  (indoor unit, outdoor condenser, temperature readout that drops as you scroll).
- **3D glass cards for the 8 HVAC services** — procedural 3D icons rendered in a *single*
  shared WebGL canvas that tracks the DOM cards (cheap on Android).
- **Immersive 3D vignettes** for Hospitals 🏥 / Commercial 🏢 / Residential 🏠.
- **Authorized Brands** section — Mitsubishi Electric, Voltas, Blue Star, Daikin, O General, LG
  (text-based glass cards; no invented logos).
- **Real showroom gallery** — 8 photos with 3D hover, lightbox, keyboard nav, mobile swipe & zoom.
- **Dynamic OPEN NOW / CLOSED indicator** based on the current time in IST (Asia/Kolkata).
- **Google Maps embed without any API key** + “Open in Google Maps” / “Get Directions” CTAs.
- **Mobile-first UX** — hamburger menu, sticky Call Now button, no horizontal overflow,
  reduced particle counts on low-end devices, `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback, WebGL fallback.
- **SEO-ready** — meta title/description, Open Graph, Twitter cards, JSON-LD (`HVACBusiness`
  schema with hours, address, rating).

## 📸 Gallery images

`public/photos/showroom-1.jpg … showroom-8.jpg` are **placeholder photographs** generated so the
site ships visually complete. Replace them with the client’s real showroom photos — keep the same
filenames (or update `src/data/content.ts` → `GALLERY_IMAGES`) and the gallery will pick them up.

## 🎯 Performance & accessibility

- Heavy 3D chunks are lazy-loaded (`React.lazy` + code-splitting) and only mounted near the viewport.
- Single shared canvas for icon grids; low particle counts on low-end/mobile devices.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables 3D & heavy animation; WebGL-less devices get a friendly fallback.
- Semantic HTML, `aria-label`s, keyboard-accessible lightbox and focus rings.

## 🔍 Verification checklist

- `npm run build` passes (type-check + bundle)
- All nav links scroll to their sections; Call / Email / Directions links use `tel:`, `mailto:`, Google Maps
- Gallery lightbox: arrows, Escape, swipe, double-click zoom
- Business-hours status reflects IST time; Sunday = Closed
- No console errors on desktop and mobile viewports
